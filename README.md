# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the decision makers at PyBer with information regarding rides, drivers, and fares within each respective city type during a period of four months in 2019. PyBer operates in multiple city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. There are multiple factors that impact their operations. The hope is to provide insight with respect to the available data.

## Results
The data demonstrates that the monetary gains are most prominent in the Urban areas. Figure 1 illusratates the aggregate fare revenue during four months in 2019. The second leading city type is Suburban, followed by Rural.

The following summarizes the PyBer Summary Chart:
- Urban cities lead in total rides, total drivers, and total fares. 
- The ratio of drivers to rides is 1.48, which is the highest amongst all city types. 
- The availability of drivers in Urban cities is far greater than Rural cities. 
- The volume of rides in the Urban areas is 13 times greater than that of Rural Cities, and 2.5 times that of Suburban Cities. 
- The total fares for Urban Cities is 9 times greater than Rural, and 2 times greater than Suburan, respectively. 
- The average fare per ride is highest in Rural areas, and lowest in Urban areas.
- The average fare per driver is lowest in Urban cities and highest in Rural cities.

## Summary
While the data set has limitations, there are a few considerations that can be provided at this time. 
- If maximizing driver efficiency is most important and assuming driver quantity is fixed: reallocate drivers from the Urban area to the Rural area. This shift in labor would enable drivers in both the Rural areas and the Urban areas to be more efficient as supply of drivers and demand of rides would be more aligned. 
- If increasing the average fare per driver is most important and assuming drivers must remain in their current city type: start a ride special campaign to increase the number of total rides in the Urban area. An increase in total rides will increase the total fares, thus increasing the average fare per driver. 
- If maximizing profit is most important, additional data regarding cost of service (i.e. fuel, insurance, downtime, etc), should be extracted and put against the desired margins.
