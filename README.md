# PyBer Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide the decision makers at Pyber with information regarding rides, drivers, and fares within each respective city type during a period of four months in 2019. Pyber operates in multiple city types: Urban, Suburban, and Rural. There are multiple factors that impact their operations. The hope is to provide insight with respect to the available data.
